# friendsSkipper

I've been watching friends but I hate the intro and now that they made the new feature to skip the intro when watching tv shows on netflix, I figured I'd hack one together quick.  Kind of silly, I'd be thrilled if someone else uses it.

Just clone the repo, go to ` chrome://extensions`, enable developer mode, then click and drag the folder into your browser and it'll work!
